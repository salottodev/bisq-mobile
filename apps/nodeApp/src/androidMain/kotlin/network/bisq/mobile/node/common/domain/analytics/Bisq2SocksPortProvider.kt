/**
 * [AnalyticsSocksPortProvider] for the bisq-easy Node app. On the node, kmp-tor
 * runs the Tor daemon (NetworkServiceFacade.activate() -> kmpTorService.startTor())
 * and bisq2 core is configured to use it as external Tor (UseExternalTor). This
 * provider reports the SOCKS proxy that bisq2 core is routing through, read from
 * its own NetworkService rather than from kmp-tor directly.
 *
 * (Historical note: an earlier version of this comment claimed kmp-tor is never
 * started on the node — that is FALSE; it is started. kmp-tor's own SOCKS port
 * is in fact available earlier than bisq2 core's, so a KmpTorSocksPortProvider
 * would resolve sooner — a possible future optimization. This provider is kept
 * for coherence with bisq2's routing.)
 *
 * bisq2's `NetworkService` does not expose an observable SOCKS-port flow; it
 * makes the SOCKS proxy available synchronously via
 * `serviceNodesByTransport.getSocksProxy(TransportType.TOR)` once Tor is
 * bootstrapped. We poll that surface every [POLL_INTERVAL_MS] until it
 * resolves, then return the port.
 *
 * Polling vs reflection-into-bisq2-observables:
 *  - Polling is robust to bisq2 API churn; the `Optional<Socks5Proxy>` contract
 *    has been stable across multiple bisq2 versions and is part of the public
 *    `NetworkService` surface mobile already depends on.
 *  - The cost is one map lookup + an exception throw on the empty-Optional path
 *    every 2s — negligible.
 *  - Bisq2 cold-start to Tor-ready is typically 30–60s on first run; this loop
 *    will tick ~15–30 times before resolving. After that the coroutine
 *    completes and the polling stops.
 *
 * No upper bound on the wait — if bisq2's Tor never bootstraps the user has
 * bigger problems than missing analytics. Cancellation via the lifecycle's
 * serviceScope is the only exit.
