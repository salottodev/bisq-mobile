/**
 * Exposes the log file the embedded bisq2 core writes through logback
 * (`ApplicationService.setupLogging` -> `LogSetup`), which lives next to the core's data in the
 * app data dir. Rolled files (`bisq_1.log`, ...) are ignored: the current file holds what a fresh
 * bug report is about.
 *
 * What is shared is never that file. [prepareForSharing] writes a redacted copy of its tail into
 * [exportDir] and hands that out; see [SHARED_LOG_TAIL_BYTES] and [LogScrubber] for the two
 * mobile-specific choices. bisq2's own log masking (`LogMaskConverter`) only hides the home
 * directory and is a no-op on Android, so the scrubbing has to happen here, at the point where
 * the file leaves the device.
