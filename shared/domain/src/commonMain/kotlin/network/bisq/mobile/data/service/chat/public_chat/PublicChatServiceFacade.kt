/**
 * The public chat channels: Discussions and Support, one channel per domain.
 *
 * Both domains are served from here even though this app version only shows Discussions, because
 * bisq2 exposes them as one surface (`PublicChatChannels`) and splitting them would mean two facades
 * over one service map. The hub's unread badge filters Support out on its own.
 *
 * Every operation is addressed by channel id, like
 * [network.bisq.mobile.data.service.chat.private_chat.PrivateChatServiceFacade] and unlike trade
 * chat's ambient selection.
 *
 * The failures are a closed set, so a presenter needs one error handler for both flavours:
 * [PublicChatSendRefusedException] for a banned or rate-limited profile,
 * [PublicChatNotAuthorException] for a message that is not mine, [PublicChatRemovalRejectedException]
 * for a removal the local store refused, and an [IllegalStateException] for a channel or message that
 * is gone.
