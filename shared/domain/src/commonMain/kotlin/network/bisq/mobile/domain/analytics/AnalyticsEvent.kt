/**
 * The complete, enumerated set of events the apps may emit to GlitchTip.
 *
 * **Why sealed.** Per the privacy agreement on bisq-network/bisq-mobile#525,
 * analytics must NEVER carry trade amounts, prices, payment-method content,
 * counterparty identities, user inputs, or any free-form payload. A `track(name,
 * props: Map<String, Any>)` overload makes accidental leakage one typo away;
 * a sealed hierarchy makes it structurally impossible.
 *
 * **Why per-event subclass instead of a single class with an enum field.**
 * Future events will carry small typed payloads (e.g. milestone names from a
 * fixed list, feature identifiers). Subclasses let each event declare exactly
 * the scope properties it needs, all reviewable in diff.
 *
 * **Adding an event.** One line: a `data object` (or `data class` if it
 * legitimately needs typed payload from a fixed enum). Code review then has a
 * single grep target — `AnalyticsEvent` — to audit the universe of what we
 * ever emit. Add the new event to the family's `.all` list so the regression
 * test in `AnalyticsEventTest` (`shared/domain` commonTest) keeps the privacy
 * audit surface honest.
 *
 * Naming convention: `<category>.<thing>_<past_participle>` (e.g.
 * `screen.dashboard_opened`, `settings.analytics_enabled`). Lowercase,
 * dot+underscore separators only.

     *    advanced), [Outcome.FAILED] (the request errored), [Outcome.STALLED] (request accepted but the
     *    local state never advanced within the watch window — the "it didn't work" symptom). We only
