/**
 * Shared base for the client and node [TradesServiceFacade] implementations, owning the trade-funnel
 * analytics wiring so it lives in exactly one place instead of being copy-pasted into both facades.
 *
 * TODO The two implementations still duplicate more than this — notably the `selectedTrade` /
 *  `openTradeItems` / `closedTradesChangeTick` backing fields. Consolidating those is a larger,
 *  riskier cleanup (the node facade's state is entangled with bisq2-thread locking), so it is
 *  intentionally deferred to a follow-up rather than folded into this analytics change.
