Instead, the trade ID should be used as reason to associate the bank transfer with the trade.\n- If the trade cannot be completed instantly due to longer Fiat transfer times, both traders must be online at least once a day to monitor the trade progress.\n- In the event that traders encounter unresolved issues, they have the option to invite a mediator into the trade chat for assistance.\n\nShould you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to visit the chat rooms accessible under the 'Support' menu.
