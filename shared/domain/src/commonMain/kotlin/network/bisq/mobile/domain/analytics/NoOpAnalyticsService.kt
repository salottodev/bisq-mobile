/**
 * Inert [AnalyticsService] implementation. Used as the default for test
 * fixtures (see `TestApplicationLifecycleService`) and as a safe substitute in
 * code paths that don't care about analytics emission. Never bound in
 * production DI — both apps always bind [SentryAnalyticsService] now; the two
 * runtime gates (dev-only build flag + user-settings toggle) handle suppression.
 *
 * By construction, when this implementation is wired:
 *  - Sentry-KMP is never touched.
 *  - No DSN is dialled, no network traffic is generated.
 *  - All calls return [Unit] without observable side effects.
