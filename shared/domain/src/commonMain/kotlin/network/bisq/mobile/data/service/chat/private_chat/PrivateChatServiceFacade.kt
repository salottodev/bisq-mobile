/**
 * Two-party private chat (DM) with an arbitrary peer, outside of a trade.
 *
 * Every operation is addressed by channel id, deliberately unlike

 * currently selected trade as ambient state. Ambient selection cannot serve a channel that is not
 * on screen, which notifications need.

    /**
     * Always true on the node. On Bisq Connect it tracks whether the paired trusted node advertises
     * the private-chat capability — an older node exposes none of the endpoints below, so callers
     * must hide the entry point rather than let the calls fail.
     *
     * Capability is not permission: the node advertises `private-chat` from a public, unauthenticated
     * endpoint, so this can be true while the pairing withheld the private-chat permission. The calls
     * below then fail with [PrivateChatNotPermittedException], not here.
     *
     * On every node released so far that permission covers the REST routes and nothing else. Bisq 2
     * authenticates a WebSocket at the handshake but does not authorise it — `SubscriptionService` has
     * no permission check and there is no WebSocket counterpart to `RestApiAuthorizationFilter` — so a
     * pairing without the permission is refused every call below and still receives the DMs themselves
     * over the `PRIVATE_CHAT_*` topics. Pre-existing and true of every topic, trade chat included.
     * bisq2#4961 (`Authorize WebSocket subscriptions without breaking existing pairings`) closes it by
     * requiring a permission per topic: against a node carrying that fix the subscription is refused
     * outright, so the DMs stop arriving instead of arriving unasked. Both behaviours have to be
     * assumed until it ships and the paired nodes catch up — the app cannot tell which node it has.
     *
     * Nothing this layer can close, and gating on the permission here would make it worse. The app does
     * not keep the granted set at all — `PairingCode.grantedPermissions` is decoded at pairing and never
     * persisted — and a stored copy would go stale the moment the node revoked one, while the node kept
     * delivering either way. The 403 is the authoritative signal, which is why every call below
     * translates it: a pairing that lost the permission still reaches the chat screen through the
     * topics, so hiding the entry point would trade that message for silent failures.
     *
     * Presenters observe this instead of reading `BackendCapabilitiesService` themselves — the exception
     * documented in `docs/architecture.md` § Feature availability services. The facade has to gate its
     * own activation on the same capability, so a second reading in a presenter would be a copy of an
     * answer that already lives here, free to drift from it.
     *
     * A flow rather than a snapshot: on Bisq Connect the capability set starts at the legacy baseline
     * and only becomes accurate once the node's manifest lands, so a caller that reads it once can
     * latch "unsupported" for good and hide the entry point with no way back.
