/**
 * ReputationBreakdownAndRankingDesign.kt
 *
 * Compose specification for a per-source reputation score breakdown and a network-wide ranking
 * list. Not wired to a presenter; state shown in the previews below is produced entirely by the
 * `simulatedXxx` helpers, which take only primitives.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. PURPOSE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `shared/presentation/.../settings/reputation/ReputationScreen.kt` shows only the aggregate score
 * and a burn/bond how-to; it does not show which of the five sources produced that score, or where
 * a profile stands against every other profile on the network. This specification adds: a "My
 * score" block (rank, total, stars, per-source contribution) on the existing reputation screen; a
 * ranking screen listing every known profile, searchable and filterable by source; and the same
 * breakdown block on the peer profile screen.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 2. DATA AND PREREQUISITE
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scope is per-source TOTALS only — the five `ReputationSource` values
 * (`BURNED_BSQ`, `BSQ_BOND`, `BISQ1_ACCOUNT_AGE`, `BISQ1_SIGNED_ACCOUNT_AGE_WITNESS`,
 * `PROFILE_AGE`) plus the total score, five-star score, and rank — not the underlying per-event
 * ledger (individual burn transactions, individual bonds, their lock times). Rank, total, and
 * stars already exist on both apps: `ReputationServiceFacade.getReputation(userProfileId)` returns
 * `ReputationScoreVO(totalScore, fiveSystemScore, ranking)`, and
 * `ReputationServiceFacade.scoreByUserProfileId: StateFlow<Map<String, Long>>` already carries
 * every known profile's total. Per-source totals do not exist on either app today; the node can
 * read them by adding calls into bisq2's `ReputationService`'s five per-source services
 * (`getProofOfBurnService`, `getBondedReputationService`, `getAccountAgeService`,
 * `getSignedWitnessService`, `getProfileAgeService` — each already sums to one number per profile,
 * the same way the node's own ranking view does), but the bisq2 REST `ReputationScoreDto` carries
 * only `totalScore`/`fiveSystemScore`/`ranking`, so Connect needs that DTO extended before this
 * ships there. The prerequisite is: extend bisq2's `ReputationScoreDto`
 * (`bisq2/api/src/main/java/bisq/api/dto/user/reputation/ReputationScoreDto.java`) with
 * `scoreBySource: Map<String, Long>` keyed by `ReputationSource.name()`, populated from the five
 * per-source services above, and advertise it via a matching `ApiFeature` entry that
 * `Feature.REPUTATION_SOURCE_BREAKDOWN` maps to (see "3. Gating"). No new endpoint: the existing
 * `/reputation/score/{userProfileId}` REST call and the reputation WebSocket subscription both
 * carry the extended DTO. An old node simply omits `scoreBySource`; the client never reads that
 * field unless the capability is advertised, so its absence is never misread as a genuine
 * all-zero breakdown. The per-event ledger (date, amount, lock time per individual
 * burn/bond/witness/age record) would need bisq2 to expose the underlying dated records
 * themselves, not just five summed numbers — a separate, larger addition, out of scope here.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 3. GATING
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Everything that depends on per-source totals is hidden unless the connected backend advertises
 * support, using the existing probe-based, fail-closed mechanism
 * (`shared/domain/.../domain/service/capabilities/BackendCapabilitiesService.kt`,
 * `BackendCapabilities.isSupported(Feature.X)`) — no version checks. A new key,
 * `Feature.REPUTATION_SOURCE_BREAKDOWN`, is added matching bisq2's `ApiFeature` for the DTO
 * extension in "2. Data and prerequisite." [ReputationBreakdownUiState.isSourceBreakdownSupported]
 * and [ReputationRankingUiState.isSourceBreakdownSupported] stand in for
 * `backendCapabilitiesService.capabilities.value.isSupported(Feature.REPUTATION_SOURCE_BREAKDOWN)`,
 * mirroring `MyTradesPresenter.showHistoryTab`'s `.map { it.isSupported(Feature.X) }` pattern and
 * `PublicChatUiState.isSupported`'s plain boolean field.
 *
 * Rank, total, and stars render unconditionally — they use the existing API, not the new one.
 * Only the per-source rows in [ReputationBreakdown] and the source filter entry in the ranking
 * screen are conditioned on support; when unsupported, the ranking still works on totals and the
 * filter control is hidden entirely, not shown disabled — a control a user can tap and get nothing
 * from is worse than a control that is not there, since the latter needs no explanation.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 4. LIST AND ROW RULES
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * [ReputationRankingScreenContent] uses a plain `LazyColumn` over the full in-memory profile list —
 * no cap, no paging — because the underlying data
 * (`UserProfileServiceFacade.userProfiles` + `ReputationServiceFacade.scoreByUserProfileId`) is
 * already a fully-synced in-memory collection on both apps; `LazyColumn` only composes the rows
 * currently on screen regardless of list length, so list size is a search-debounce concern, not a
 * memory or composition one. Search text is debounced the same way market search already is
 * elsewhere in this app, rather than re-filtering the whole list on every keystroke.
 *
 * Each row shows exactly ONE number: the total score by default, or the selected source's value
 * while a source filter is active — never both at once. A row is already tight on a phone width
 * (avatar, name, one number, stars); Desktop can show a score column and a value column side by
 * side because it has a whole window to spend, mobile does not. A small caption under the number
 * names which value is showing ("Total score" or the source's own display name reused from
 * `reputation.source.*`), so switching the filter never leaves the number ambiguous about what it
 * now means.
 *
 * Sort order: without a source filter, rows sort by total score descending, ties broken by
 * display name. With a source filter active, rows sort by the selected source's value
 * descending, ties broken by total score descending then by name; a profile with no value at all
 * for the selected source sorts last — the row always sorts by the same number it is currently
 * displaying, so the visible order and the visible number never contradict each other.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 5. SOURCE FILTER
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * [ReputationSourceFilterSheet] reuses the existing bottom-sheet single-select pattern
 * (`BisqSelect`, the same molecule `MarketFilters`' own sheet already uses) rather than a
 * segmented row of six labels — several source names are two words
 * (`reputation.source.BISQ1_SIGNED_ACCOUNT_AGE_WITNESS` = "Signed witness"), and six segments do
 * not fit a phone width the way `MarketFilter`'s two or three already barely do. The six entries
 * are "All" (reusing the existing generic `mobile.components.marketFilter.showMarkets.all` string)
 * plus the five `reputation.source.*` labels, already translated.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 6. OWN POSITION
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The user's own rank is shown in the "My score" block via the already-available
 * `ReputationScoreVO.ranking` — no ranking-screen mechanism is needed just to answer "where do I
 * stand," that number is already on the reputation screen before the ranking screen is ever
 * opened. The ranking screen additionally offers a "jump to me" action that scrolls the list to
 * the row matching the local profile id, rather than pinning that row at the top out of its sorted
 * position — pinning duplicates the row (it would appear twice: once at the top, once in its
 * natural sorted place) for a question the My-score block already answers; a scroll action costs
 * nothing extra once the row's index in the current sort/filter is known, which it is, since the
 * row is already being rendered somewhere in the same list.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 7. ZERO VS. UNKNOWN
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * [ReputationDisplayStatus] has three values: `UNKNOWN` (the profile's score has not synced yet —
 * this is `PeerProfileScreen`'s existing `isReputationUnknown` condition, kept as-is, with its
 * existing `mobile.peerProfile.reputationUnavailable` copy and no star row at all, since an empty
 * star row would misread as a confirmed zero), `ZERO` (the score IS known and it is confirmed
 * zero), and `SCORED` (a positive total). `ZERO` gets its own copy
 * (`mobile.reputation.zeroReputation`) distinct from the unknown-state copy, and DOES render an
 * empty star row plus the rank — an empty row is the accurate representation of a confirmed zero,
 * which is exactly the misreading the `UNKNOWN` branch avoids by showing no stars at all. In the
 * ranking list itself, a zero-score row needs no special copy: it is listed last, in sorted order,
 * with a plain "0" — a list of numbers does not need the same disambiguation a single profile's
 * summary block does, and every row in that list already has a known, synced score by
 * construction (a profile with no data at all would not appear in the ranking in the first place).
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 8. ACCESSIBILITY
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Row names use `singleLine = true` with ellipsis rather than wrapping, so a long localized
 *   display name does not push row height around in a list this long — see
 *   [ReputationRankingScreenContent_LongLocaleText_Preview].
 * - The source filter's `BisqSelect` already provides standard list-item touch targets and
 *   keyboard/search navigation; no custom control is built for it.
 * - The zero-state and unknown-state copy are real, distinct text, not an icon-only distinction —
 *   a screen reader announces which of the two it is rather than only "empty stars."
 * - `Modifier.testTag(...)` marks each ranking row, the search field, the filter entry, the
 *   "jump to me" action, and the breakdown block's per-source rows.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 9. PROPOSED I18N KEYS
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * English base values only, per repo convention — nothing is added to `mobile.properties` by this
 * file; production implementation adds these.
 *
 * New:
 *   mobile.reputation.myScore.headline = "My score"
 *   mobile.reputation.myScore.rank = "Rank #{0}"
 *   mobile.reputation.viewFullRanking = "View full ranking"
 *   mobile.reputation.sourceBreakdown.unsupportedNotice = "Per-source details aren't available on
 *     this connection yet."
 *   mobile.reputation.zeroReputation = "This profile hasn't built any reputation yet."
 *   mobile.reputation.ranking.searchEmptyState = "No profiles match your search."
 *   mobile.reputation.ranking.emptyState = "No profiles to rank yet."
 *   mobile.reputation.ranking.jumpToMe = "Jump to me"
 *   mobile.reputation.ranking.valueCaption.total = "Total score"
 *
 * Reused, already present (all 14 locales) in `shared/domain/.../GeneratedResourceBundles_*.kt`:
 *   reputation.source.BURNED_BSQ / .BSQ_BOND / .BISQ1_ACCOUNT_AGE /
 *     .BISQ1_SIGNED_ACCOUNT_AGE_WITNESS / .PROFILE_AGE (source display names and value captions)
 *   reputation.table.headline = "Reputation ranking" (ranking screen title)
 *   reputation.table.entriesUnit = "User profiles"
 *   reputation.table.columns.userProfile / .reputationScore / .reputation
 *   reputation.reputationScore.headline / .intro / .sellerReputation / .explanation.intro /
 *     .explanation.score.title / .explanation.score.description / .explanation.ranking.title /
 *     .explanation.ranking.description / .explanation.stars.title / .explanation.stars
 *     .description / .closing — Desktop's explanatory Score-tab text, folded into the existing
 *     how-to content on the reputation screen as plain sections, not a tab.
 *   mobile.components.marketFilter.showMarkets.all = "All" (source filter's "All" option)
 *   mobile.peerProfile.reputationUnavailable / mobile.peerProfile.reputation (existing
 *     `PeerProfileScreen` unknown-state and scored-state copy, reused by [ReputationBreakdown])
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 10. TESTS TO ADD
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Presenter test: the per-source rows and the filter entry are absent when
 *   `isSupported(Feature.REPUTATION_SOURCE_BREAKDOWN)` is false, and rank/total/stars still render
 *   from the existing API; they appear the moment the capability flips to true, with no version
 *   comparison involved.
 * - Presenter test for the ranking list: selecting a source changes every row's displayed number
 *   and caption without changing the row order truth (still sorted by the field the row displays);
 *   clearing the filter restores totals; the list is unaffected by profile count beyond normal
 *   `LazyColumn` composition (no artificial truncation at any size).
 * - Presenter test for own position: "jump to me" resolves to the correct row index for the
 *   current sort/filter/search combination, including when the filter changes after the action was
 *   last used.
 * - UI test for the breakdown block: `UNKNOWN` renders no stars and the unavailable copy; `ZERO`
 *   renders empty stars, the rank, and the zero copy; `SCORED` renders stars, total, rank, and
 *   (when supported) the five source rows.
 * - Presenter test for sort order: unfiltered rows sort by total score descending (ties by name);
 *   selecting a source re-sorts by that source's value descending, ties broken by total score
 *   descending then name, with no-value-for-that-source rows sorting last; clearing the filter
 *   restores the unfiltered order.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 11. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR THE DEVELOPER
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Add `REPUTATION_SOURCE_BREAKDOWN("reputation-source-breakdown")` to
 *   `shared/domain/.../domain/service/capabilities/Feature.kt`, matching the bisq2 `ApiFeature`
 *   key added alongside the `ReputationScoreDto` extension in "2. Data and prerequisite."
 * - `ReputationServiceFacade` needs a `getReputationSourceBreakdown(userProfileId):
 *   Result<Map<ReputationSource, Long>>` (or equivalent) call, gated the same way other
 *   capability-dependent calls already are; the node implementation reads the five per-source
 *   bisq2 services directly, the client implementation calls the extended REST endpoint.
 * - `NavRoute` needs a new `ReputationRanking` entry (plain, no parameters) reached from the
 *   existing `Reputation` screen's new "View full ranking" action.
 * - `ReputationScreen.kt`: add the "My score" block ([ReputationBreakdown] fed from the local
 *   profile's id) above the existing intro/formula content, and the "View full ranking" entry
 *   below it; fold `reputation.reputationScore.*` into the existing how-to `BisqCard`s as
 *   additional plain sections.
 * - `PeerProfileScreen.kt`: render [ReputationBreakdown] in place of the existing inline
 *   stars/text block (see the file's own `isReputationUnknown` branch), passing through the same
 *   `ZERO`/`UNKNOWN`/`SCORED` distinction this design adds.
