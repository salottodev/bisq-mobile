     * Privacy: a two-party channel id is `domain.<profileIdA>-<profileIdB>`, so it names both ends
     * of a private conversation — strictly more than a bare profile id. Notification ids reach log
     * sinks on both platforms ([NotificationController] implementations log the id they post and
     * cancel), and logs persist to disk and ride along in bug reports, so only a digest of the
     * channel id leaves this function. The trade ids above are already shortened for the same
     * reason. The digest covers the id and the group, not the press intent: navigating needs the
     * raw channel id, so `PrivateChatNotificationService`'s `pressAction` carries it in the route.
     *
     * Stability within a process is what matters here, not a value that agrees across platforms:
     * the id is produced, posted and cancelled by the same app, and iOS' NSE deliberately keys its
     * pre-rendered notifications differently (see `NotificationService.swift`). A hash collision
     * would merely make two conversations share one tray entry; Android already reduces the id to
     * `hashCode()` before handing it to the system.
