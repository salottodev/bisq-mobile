/**
 * ConnectionsCardDesign.kt — Design PoC (Issues #1524 / #1525)
 *
 * STATUS: Design proof-of-concept. NOT wired to any presenter or production code.
 * Nothing here talks to Koin, `NodePeerInfo`, or a bisq2 `ConnectionDto` — all preview
 * data flows through [simulatedPeerConnection] (per-peer) and [simulatedNodeIdentity]
 * (screen-level keyId/nodeTag), both of which take only primitives.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * PURPOSE
 * ======================================================================================
 * Redesign of the per-peer connection card used by the Node app's Connections screen
 * (production file: `apps/nodeApp/.../network/presentation/connections/NetworkConnectionsScreen.kt`,
 * `ConnectionCard` composable). Today that card shows only: direction dot, address
 * (tail-ellipsized), established date/time, and a "seed" badge. This PoC brings it up to
 * feature parity with Bisq2 Desktop's connection table while staying scannable in a long
 * mobile list.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * DESKTOP REFERENCE FIELD SET
 * ======================================================================================
 * `bisq2/apps/desktop/desktop/.../network/p2p_network/transport/ConnectionListItem.java`
 * exposes per peer: address, direction, creation date + time, RTT (formatted duration,
 * "-" until first measured), sent bytes + message count (live via `Connection.Listener`),
 * received bytes + message count, keyId, and nodeTag. keyId/nodeTag are NOT per-peer data
 * — see "KEY ID / NODE TAG — RELOCATED" below, this was corrected after tracing the bisq2
 * source with the team.
 *
 * Desktop also carries a `peer` field (username lookup via `UserProfileService`, falling
 * back to "Seed"/"Default"). NOT ported here — for P2P transport-layer connections it
 * resolves to the fallback string almost always, which just duplicates the `[SEED]` badge
 * the mobile card already has. Flag to product if there's a use case this misses.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * KEY ID / NODE TAG — RELOCATED OUT OF THE PER-PEER CARD
 * ======================================================================================
 * Initial drafts of this design put keyId/nodeTag inside each card's expanded section.
 * That was wrong: in `ConnectionListItem`, `keyId = node.getNetworkId().getKeyId()` and
 * `nodeTag` comes from `identityService.findAnyIdentityByNetworkId(node.getNetworkId())` —
 * both describe the LOCAL node's OWN identity, not anything about the peer. They are
 * IDENTICAL on every row of the table. Harmless as extra desktop table columns; on a
 * mobile per-peer card, repeating the same value on every single card is pure redundancy.
 *
 * Fixed placement: [ConnectionsScreenIdentityHeader] renders keyId + nodeTag ONCE, above
 * the peer list (see "Data sourcing" below for exactly where each app reads it from). The
 * per-peer card's expanded section now holds only Sent/Received.
 *
 * Node-app note: the "My Node" sub-page (`NetworkInfoDesign.kt`, issue #429) already shows
 * this node's keyId in more depth (full value + copy, alongside version/Tor status). This
 * header is a compact one-line echo for context ("these connections belong to THIS
 * identity"), not a duplicate deep-dive — deliberately terse (truncated + copy icon only).
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * COLLAPSED VS. EXPANDED — WHY RTT STAYS VISIBLE AND THE REST DOESN'T
 * ======================================================================================
 * The collapsed card is deliberately kept at ~today's height (2 rows) so a 40+ peer list
 * scans exactly as fast as it does now. Of the new per-peer fields, only RTT earns a
 * permanent slot:
 *   - RTT answers "is this connection healthy" — the one thing worth acting on while
 *     scanning a long list (e.g. spotting the peer stuck at "–").
 *   - Sent/received bytes are debugging-tier ("is data actually flowing") — useful when
 *     investigating ONE peer, noise across forty.
 * Sent/received live behind a tap-to-expand chevron: a single 12dp `ArrowDownIcon` rotated
 * 0f -> 180f, so it points down when collapsed ("there is more below") and up when expanded
 * ("tap to close"). This deliberately differs from the `FaqScreenDesign.kt` accordion's
 * right/down icon swap — review feedback on #1650 was that a right-pointing chevron reads as
 * "navigates elsewhere" rather than "expands here". Rotating one asset rather than swapping
 * in a second keeps both states pixel-identical (there is no matching 12dp up-chevron
 * drawable). The FAQ accordion was intentionally left unchanged, so the two now diverge.
 *
 * RTT color-coding (green/amber/red) was considered and REJECTED for v1: Tor circuit
 * latency normally runs 300-800ms+, and there's no vetted threshold — a red badge would
 * misread as "broken" when it's just Tor being Tor. RTT renders as plain text.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * ADDRESS / KEY ID TRUNCATION + COPY
 * ======================================================================================
 * Onion v3 addresses are random base32 hashes — there's no meaningful prefix to scan by,
 * but the trailing `:port` IS meaningful (varies across a user's own nodes), so plain
 * tail-ellipsis (today's behavior) silently discards it. [truncateMiddle] keeps head +
 * tail, sized to preserve the port — this generalizes the same head+tail approach already
 * used by `OnionAddressRow` in `NetworkInfoDesign.kt`; extract a shared util at
 * implementation time instead of maintaining two copies. keyId (now in
 * [ConnectionsScreenIdentityHeader], not the card) has no port-equivalent tail worth
 * preserving, so [truncateLeading] (prefix + ellipsis) is enough for it.
 *
 * Both address and keyId get an inline [CopyIconButton] (the real atom —
 * `atoms/button/CopyIconButton.kt` — not a placeholder). Tapping the truncated text itself
 * does NOT copy; only the small copy icon does. This avoids an ambiguous gesture since the
 * whole card is also a tap target for expand/collapse. Compose's nested-clickable
 * consumption means the inner `IconButton` swallows its own tap before it reaches the
 * card's `clickable` — verify this on-device during implementation, but it's the same
 * mechanism every other inline icon-button-inside-clickable-row in this codebase relies on.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * DATA SOURCING — WHERE EACH FIELD COMES FROM, PER APP (traced against bisq2 branch
 * `network-info-connect`, issue #4878)
 * ======================================================================================
 * No new bisq2 endpoints are needed for either app. Node reads everything locally;
 * Connect needs the EXISTING NETWORK_INFO websocket topic's `ConnectionDto` widened, not a
 * new one.
 *
 * Per-peer fields — same bisq2 source for both apps
 * (`bisq.network.p2p.node.network_load.ConnectionMetrics`, via `connection.getConnectionMetrics()`):
 *   - rttMillis            <- Math.round(connectionMetrics.getAverageRtt())
 *   - sentBytes            <- connectionMetrics.getSentBytes()
 *   - sentMessageCount     <- connectionMetrics.getNumMessagesSent()
 *   - receivedBytes        <- connectionMetrics.getReceivedBytes()
 *   - receivedMessageCount <- connectionMetrics.getNumMessagesReceived()
 *   - establishedAtMillis  <- connectionMetrics.getCreationDate() (already present today)
 *   - isOutbound           <- connection.isOutboundConnection() (already present today)
 *   - address              <- connection.getPeerAddress().getFullAddress() (already present)
 *   - isSeed               <- peerGroupService.isSeed(peerAddress) (already present today)
 *
 * Node app (`apps/nodeApp/.../NodeNetworkServiceFacade.kt`): all of the above is available
 * IN-PROCESS off the local bisq2 `Connection` objects the facade already holds. No bisq2
 * API change, no new endpoint — just read the extra fields off `getConnectionMetrics()`
 * when building `NodePeerInfo`.
 *
 * Connect app (via trusted node): widen the EXISTING `api/src/main/java/bisq/api/dto/network/ConnectionDto.java`
 * (currently `connectionId, address, outbound, seed, establishedAtMillis`) with the five
 * fields above, and populate them in `NetworkInfoWebSocketService.toConnectionDtos()` —
 * it already iterates the node's `Connection` objects, so `getConnectionMetrics()` is
 * right there. This is a bisq2-side change (#4878 or a follow-up) + jar bump, but it rides
 * the existing NETWORK_INFO topic — no new endpoint. Mirror the widened DTO in the mobile
 * client's `NetworkInfoDto`/`ConnectionDto` and map to `NodePeerInfo`.
 *
 * Node-level identity fields (shown once, in [ConnectionsScreenIdentityHeader], not per-peer):
 *   - keyId    <- Node: `node.getNetworkId().getKeyId()` (own identity). Connect: the
 *                 trusted node's keyId — ALREADY present as `NetworkInfoDto.keyId` at the
 *                 top level, per issue #429's Overview screen work. No new field.
 *   - nodeTag  <- Node: `identityService.findAnyIdentityByNetworkId(...)`. Connect: NEW —
 *                 `NetworkInfoDto` has no `nodeTag` field yet; needs adding once (not
 *                 per-peer) alongside the #4878 DTO work.
 * Optional/future: Desktop also resolves a peer USERNAME per row via `UserProfileService` —
 * available later if there's a use case, not required for this design.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * I18N KEYS NEEDED
 * ======================================================================================
 * This PoC hardcodes literal English strings (project convention for design PoCs — see
 * `TradePaymentAccountSelectionDesign.kt`). Production wiring needs, added alongside the
 * existing `mobile.networkInfo.connections.*` block
 * (`shared/domain/src/commonMain/resources/mobile/mobile.properties`, ~line 330):
 *
 *   mobile.networkInfo.connections.rtt=RTT
 *   mobile.networkInfo.connections.sent=Sent
 *   mobile.networkInfo.connections.received=Received
 *   mobile.networkInfo.connections.identity.keyId=Key ID
 *   mobile.networkInfo.connections.identity.nodeTag=Node tag
 *   mobile.networkInfo.connections.ioData.1={0} · {1} message
 *   mobile.networkInfo.connections.ioData.*={0} · {1} messages
 *   mobile.networkInfo.connections.expand=Show connection details
 *   mobile.networkInfo.connections.collapse=Hide connection details
 *
 * Expansion check: "SENT"/"RECEIVED" are short in English but run ~30-40% longer in
 * German/Russian inside the 2-column expanded layout. They're non-critical secondary
 * labels — let them wrap to 2 lines rather than truncating. Same applies to the "Key ID"/
 * "Node tag" labels in [ConnectionsScreenIdentityHeader].
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * HANDOFF — WHAT THE DEVELOPER NEEDS TO WIRE
 * ======================================================================================
 * (a) Data-field contract — see "Data sourcing" above for exact bisq2 origins.
 *     `NodePeerInfo` (`apps/nodeApp/.../common/domain/service/network/NodePeerInfo.kt`)
 *     currently has `connectionId, address, isOutbound, establishedAtMillis, isSeed`. Add
 *     PER-PEER: `rttMillis: Long?` (null until first measured — maps to this PoC's `-1L`
 *     sentinel), `sentBytes: Long`, `sentMessageCount: Int`, `receivedBytes: Long`,
 *     `receivedMessageCount: Int`. The bisq2 `ConnectionDto` (Connect app) needs the same
 *     per-peer shape so ONE card design serves both apps, per the issue requirement.
 *     keyId/nodeTag are NOT part of this per-peer contract — see (a2).
 *
 * (a2) Node-level identity contract (separate from NodePeerInfo). Node: read
 *     `node.getNetworkId().getKeyId()` / the identity tag directly in the Node app's
 *     Network Info presenter, same as the existing "My Node" sub-page already does.
 *     Connect: `keyId` is already on `NetworkInfoDto` (issue #429) — just thread it into
 *     this screen too. `nodeTag` is NOT yet on `NetworkInfoDto` — add it once, at the
 *     top level, alongside the #4878 DTO widening (NOT on the per-peer DTO).
 *
 * (b) `ByteUnitUtil.formatBytesPrecise`
 *     (`shared/domain/src/androidMain/.../utils/ByteUnitUtil.kt`) is androidMain-only
 *     despite being pure Kotlin math (no platform dependency) — move it to commonMain
 *     before wiring this card, otherwise iOS/Connect can't format sent/received bytes.
 *     [formatBytes] below duplicates its logic ONLY because of this gap — delete the local
 *     copy once the move happens.
 *
 * (c) Live updates. `NetworkConnectionsPresenter.onViewAttached()` currently only
 *     re-emits `connectedPeers` on peer set changes (connect/disconnect), not on metric
 *     changes. Desktop updates sent/received/RTT per network message via
 *     `Connection.Listener` — too chatty for a mobile `LazyColumn`. Recommended: a
 *     periodic re-snapshot (3-5s tick) that re-emits the whole peers list with fresh
 *     metrics, not a per-message push.
 *
 * (d) Connect app scope. The "My Connection" screen was cut — this Connections list is
 *     the WHOLE per-peer story for Connect. Same card design serves both Node (local data)
 *     and Connect (data arrives via the expanded `ConnectionDto` from the trusted node) —
 *     no per-app card variant needed, unlike the Overview screen in
 *     `NetworkInfoConnectDesign.kt` which does split Node/Connect.
