 * The keys are constants rather than literals inline because the relayed path needs the same four
 * strings for a second purpose: `BisqFirebaseMessagingService.NotificationCategory` titles its
 * category banner with them. Both sides reading one constant is what makes "the banner and its
 * redaction say the same thing" true by construction — the property the whole design rests on, since
 * it is why redacting a category banner costs nothing. Written twice, they would agree until someone
