/**
 * CommunityPushNotificationsDesign.kt — Design PoC (Milestone 11 "Bisq community")
 *
 * STATUS: Design proof-of-concept. NOT wired to any presenter or production code.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * PURPOSE
 * ======================================================================================
 * Defines the notification COPY (title/body strings) and deep-link behaviour for the
 * community surface — new private message (#590) and channel mention/reply in
 * Discussions (#589) — for both the app-backgrounded and app-killed cases. This is a
 * documentation-and-mock-preview file: real system notifications are OS chrome, not
 * something Compose renders, so there is no real `NotificationCompat`/
 * `UNMutableNotificationContent` preview possible. See "WHY THESE ARE MOCK PREVIEWS"
 * below for exactly what IS and ISN'T previewable here.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * WHAT ALREADY EXISTS — aligned with, not reinvented (survey before designing)
 * ======================================================================================
 * This app already has a full, working, PRIVACY-CONSCIOUS notification pipeline for
 * trade messages. This file extends that exact pipeline; it does not propose a new one.
 *
 * 1. LOCAL notifications (app backgrounded but the process is alive — the default,
 *    non-relayed path):
 *    `OpenTradesNotificationService` (presentation/common/service/) observes trade chat
 *    messages and posts rich, full-content notifications via
 *    `NotificationController.notify { ... }` (presentation/common/notification/
 *    NotificationController.kt) — a builder DSL setting `id`, `title`, `body`, and a
 *    platform-specific `pressAction` (`NotificationPressAction.Route(NavRoute.X)` — see
 *    NotificationPressAction.kt) that deep-links a tap straight to the relevant screen.
 *    Existing trade-chat copy (mobile.properties):
 *    ```
 *    mobile.openTradeNotifications.newMessage.title   = Trade [{0}]
 *    mobile.openTradeNotifications.newMessage.message = You have a new message from {0}
 *    ```
 *    Posted on `NotificationChannels.USER_MESSAGES` (NotificationChannels.kt) — a channel
 *    that ALREADY EXISTS and is semantically exactly "a message from another user",
 *    which is what both DM and channel-mention notifications are. REUSED below, not
 *    duplicated with a new channel.
 *
 * 2. RELAYED notifications (app killed, or the user opted into relayed/FCM-APNs
 *    delivery — see `mobile.pushNotifications.optIn.*` copy already in mobile.properties):
 *    the trusted node encrypts a payload (AES-256-GCM) and pushes it through
 *    Google/Apple. CRITICALLY, this path is privacy-restricted by design — the decrypted
 *    content is NEVER shown in the system notification tray, only a generic,
 *    CATEGORY-based summary is:
 *    - Android: `BisqFirebaseMessagingService.NotificationCategory` (apps/clientApp/.../
 *      push_notification/) — `TRADE_UPDATE`, `CHAT_MESSAGE`, `OFFER_UPDATE`, `GENERAL`.
 *    - iOS: `NotificationService.swift`'s `NotificationCategory` enum (Notification
 *      Service Extension) — same four categories, same display text, decrypts
 *      server-side-encrypted payloads on-device before display but STILL only shows the
 *      category summary, never the plaintext.
 *    - Display text (mobile.properties, already exists):
 *      ```
 *      mobile.pushNotifications.category.tradeUpdate = Trade update
 *      mobile.pushNotifications.category.chatMessage  = New message
 *      mobile.pushNotifications.category.offerUpdate  = Offer update
 *      mobile.pushNotifications.category.general      = New notification
 *      ```
 *    - The system notification's title is ALWAYS the literal app name ("Bisq"), never a
 *      peer name or channel name, on both platforms.
 *    - Both platforms already carry an optional `tradeId` field in the decrypted payload
 *      (bisq-network/bisq-mobile#1395) so a tap can deep-link straight to the specific
 *      trade when the trusted node supplies it, falling back to the trade list when it
 *      doesn't (older trusted nodes). This exact fallback shape is reused below for
 *      community deep links.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * UPDATE 2026-08-16 — the relayed banner now names the peer (#590 private chat)
 * ======================================================================================
 * The survey in section 2 above is preserved as written, because it is the record of what
 * the code did when this file was authored. Two of its statements no longer hold:
 *
 * - ":45-46" — the relayed banner is no longer a category-only summary for chat messages.
 * - ":60-61" — its title is no longer always the literal app name.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED: a relayed chat push now composes the same banner the LOCAL path already
 * composed — "New message / You received a new message from {peer}" for a DM, "Trade [{id}]
 * / You have a new message from {peer}" for a trade chat — from the same mobile.properties
 * keys. Trade updates, offers and general notifications are untouched and still show the
 * category summary. The message BODY is still never displayed: bisq2 sends it in
 * `payload.message` and both clients discard it.
 *
 * WHY: at display time there is no threat-model difference between the two paths. The
 * payload is decrypted on-device, so Google/APNs never see the banner; it is the same
 * phone, the same lock screen and the same notification listeners as a locally raised
 * notification, which has named the peer since long before this. The asymmetry was
 * historical — the relay shipped opt-in with a conservative default and the two paths were
 * never reconciled — not a response to a distinct risk. A new `peerUserName` wire field
 * carries the name so the client can compose in the USER's locale; bisq2 builds
 * `payload.title` / `payload.message` with `Res.get(...)` in the NODE's.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * UPDATE 2026-08-16 (second pass) — lock-screen policy, answering the MUST below
 * ======================================================================================
 * The visibility/redaction policy demanded below for the local path is now DEFINED for chat
 * on Android, on both paths. Writing it turned up that the two paths had silently disagreed:
 *
 * - LOCAL was VISIBILITY_PUBLIC, explicitly, because that was the DSL default and no caller
 *   ever overrode it.
 * - RELAYED was VISIBILITY_PRIVATE, by accident: `BisqFirebaseMessagingService` builds its
 *   own `NotificationCompat.Builder` and never called `setVisibility`, and that builder
 *   defaults to PRIVATE. So the path showing MORE was the more exposed one, and neither
 *   posture had been chosen. (An earlier revision of this block claimed everything was
 *   PUBLIC. That was wrong for the relayed path.)
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOW: EVERY category is VISIBILITY_PRIVATE with a redacted public form of "Bisq"
 * / its category summary — chat "New message", and the trade / offer / general equivalents —
 * built by `NotificationRedactions`, which both paths call. One function per category, so the
 * two paths cannot drift. On the relayed path nobody states it per variant either: it is
 * derived, `NotificationCategory.lockScreenRedaction` in `BisqFirebaseMessagingService`.
 *
 * Trade updates, offers and general used to keep ShowContent, on the argument that their copy
 * is already a bare category summary so redacting would protect nothing and only cost the
 * user information. THAT ARGUMENT WAS WRONG, and it is worth recording why rather than just
 * deleting it. The banner and its stand-in are built from the SAME
 * `NotificationCategory.displayTextKey`, so redacting one into the other says exactly the
 * same thing — nothing was being traded away. What ShowContent did buy was VISIBILITY_PUBLIC,
 * which OVERRIDES a lock screen whose owner chose to hide sensitive content. The opt-out
 * overrode the user and returned nothing. It is now derived from the category precisely so
 * that no variant can opt out by omission, and
 * `no push variant shows its content on the lock screen` holds the line.
 *
 * The DSL knob is `AndroidNotificationConfig.lockScreen: AndroidLockScreenPolicy`
 * (ShowContent / Redact(title, body) / Hide), replacing the unused
 * `AndroidNotificationVisibility`. One knob rather than Android's two, because `visibility`
 * and `publicVersion` as separate fields make two nonsense states representable: PRIVATE with
 * no redacted form (Android substitutes its own placeholder, so our copy never shows), and a
 * publicVersion on a PUBLIC notification (never rendered).
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT BUY, stated plainly so nobody over-reads it:
 * - It only engages on a device with a SECURE lock whose owner chose "hide sensitive
 *   content". On the common "show all content" setting the full copy still appears on the
 *   lock screen. It is not a switch we control.
 * - It governs SystemUI rendering only. An app holding notification-listener access reads the
 *   real title and text regardless. Defence against shoulder-surfing, not against on-device
 *   exfiltration.
 *
 * iOS gets no lock-screen policy of its own: "Show Previews: When Unlocked" is the system
 * default, so the OS already withholds the copy on a locked device and substitutes its own
 * placeholder. Customising that text means registering `UNNotificationCategory` with a
 * `hiddenPreviewsBodyPlaceholder` and setting `categoryIdentifier` on both paths — a larger
 * change to improve on something the platform already handles.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, not fixed here: the iOS NSE composes the relayed banner from English literals. The
 * extension cannot reach the generated Kotlin bundles, so "the client composes in the USER's
 * locale" — the reason `peerUserName` travels on the wire at all — holds on Android only. An iOS
 * user on a Spanish device reads the local notification in Spanish and the relayed one in English.
 * Pre-existing (the category summaries there were always English), but this change widened it.
 *
 * Whoever picks it up: do NOT reach for `NSLocalizedString`. `I18nSupport.setLanguage` looks
 * `NSLocale.currentLocale.languageCode` — a bare code, "pt" not "pt-BR" — up in a map keyed
 * `"pt-BR"`, `"af-ZA"`, `"pcm-NG"`, so those three already fall back to English app-wide on iOS.
 * Apple's own resolution matches them, which would leave a Portuguese banner over an English app.
 * Localising the NSE means mirroring the app's rule, and is worth doing together with fixing that
 * rule, on both paths at once.
 *
 * STILL OPEN: the same question for iOS above, and whether `Hide` (SECRET) is the better
 * answer for DMs than `Redact`.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * DECISION: NO NEW CATEGORY, NO NEW CHANNEL
 * ======================================================================================
 * [2026-08-16] Conclusion unchanged, but argument (a) below no longer applies as written:
 * the relayed display text is NOT identical between a DM and a trade chat any more (see the
 * update above). The conclusion survives on other grounds — the two are already told apart
 * by which routing id the payload carries, which is needed for deep linking regardless, so a
 * wire category would be a second discriminator that can contradict the first. Argument (b),
 * the extra row in Android's notification-channel settings, is untouched and still the
 * strongest reason.
 *
 * Both DM messages and Discussions mentions/replies are, semantically and from a privacy
 * standpoint, the exact same thing the existing `CHAT_MESSAGE` category / `USER_MESSAGES`
 * channel already models: "a message from another user arrived, go look." Introducing a
 * separate `community_message` category would (a) require the trusted node to learn a
 * new wire value for no user-facing benefit, since the relayed-path display text is
 * identical either way ("New message"), and (b) add a 5th line to Android's
 * notification-channel settings list for a distinction only visible in the LOCAL
 * (rich-copy) case, where the copy itself already disambiguates. RECOMMENDATION: reuse
 * `CHAT_MESSAGE` / `USER_MESSAGES` for both. This is the same "align with what exists,
 * don't reinvent" instruction applied to the notification layer.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * LOCAL (rich) COPY — new keys, mirroring openTradeNotifications' title/body split
 * ======================================================================================
 * Only shown when the app generates the notification itself (foreground service alive,
 * non-relayed). Bypassing FCM/APNs only removes the THIRD-PARTY (Google/Apple) interception
 * risk — it does NOT prevent the OS notification chrome from rendering this content on the
 * lock screen / notification shade, where anyone with physical access to the device sees it.
 * So "full content" here is NOT automatically safe. Production MUST define and document an
 * explicit visibility/redaction policy before relying on this as a privacy boundary — e.g.
 * Android `NotificationCompat.VISIBILITY_PRIVATE` with a redacted public form, and the iOS
 * equivalent (hidden preview / redacted `content` on the lock screen) — mirroring the app's
 * existing privacy posture for trade-message notifications.
 * [2026-08-16] Done for Android, on both paths; iOS relies on the platform default. See the
 * "lock-screen policy" update above for what was chosen and what it does not cover.
 *
 * Private message (#590, fast-follow):
 * ```
 * mobile.communityNotifications.newDirectMessage.title   = New private message
 * mobile.communityNotifications.newDirectMessage.message = {0}: {1}
 * ```
 * {0} = sender display name, {1} = message preview (presenter truncates to ~80 chars
 * with ellipsis — same truncation convention as `ConversationRow`'s 1-line preview in
 * PrivateChatListScreenDesign.kt, for visual/data consistency between the notification
 * and the inbox row the user lands on after tapping it).
 *
 * Discussions channel — MENTION mode (#589, ships this milestone; RECOMMENDED default —
 * see "NOTIFICATION MODE DEFAULT" below):
 * ```
 * mobile.communityNotifications.channelMention.title   = You were mentioned in {0}
 * mobile.communityNotifications.channelMention.message = {0}: {1}
 * ```
 * Title {0} = channel display name. Message {0} = sender name, {1} = message preview
 * (same truncation convention as above).
 *
 * Discussions channel — ALL mode (opt-in per channel, busier):
 * ```
 * mobile.communityNotifications.channelMessage.title   = New message in {0}
 * mobile.communityNotifications.channelMessage.message = {0}: {1}
 * ```
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * NOTIFICATION MODE DEFAULT — tied to bisq2's own per-channel setting
 * ======================================================================================
 * bisq2 already models this exact choice per channel:
 * `ChatChannelNotificationTypeEnum` (data/replicated/chat/notifications/) —
 * `GLOBAL_DEFAULT | ALL | MENTION | OFF`. RECOMMENDATION: default the Discussion channel
 * membership to `MENTION`, not `ALL`. It's a many-to-many public channel and can be
 * high-traffic (see CommunityHubScreenDesign.kt's "Discussion" fixture: 1284 members) —
 * notifying on every single message would be Discord/Slack's exact well-known
 * anti-pattern for large channels. `ALL` stays available as an opt-in for a user who
 * explicitly wants full coverage. Both copy variants above exist because both modes are
 * real, reachable states — not because MENTION is the only one shipping.
 *
 * OUT OF SCOPE HERE: notification copy/defaults specifically for the Support channel.
 * Support is reached via a pinned hub reference and the existing More → Help → Support
 * screen, not a segment (see CommunityHubScreenDesign.kt's "SUPPORT — HUB-SIDE
 * REFERENCE") — whether/how it needs its own notification treatment is a separate design
 * pass, not addressed by this file's MENTION/ALL recommendation, which is scoped to the
 * Discussion channel only.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * RELAYED (killed-app / opted-into-relay) COPY — reuses existing keys, no new ones
 * ======================================================================================
 * Uses the EXISTING `mobile.pushNotifications.category.chatMessage` = "New message" for
 * ALL THREE cases above (DM, mention, ALL-mode message) — same generic text already
 * shown for trade-chat relayed notifications today. No new privacy-category work
 * required; this is a direct consequence of the "no new category" decision above.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * DEEP LINKING
 * ======================================================================================
 * LOCAL path (rich, this milestone can wire immediately once the routes exist):
 *   `NotificationPressAction.Route(NavRoute.DiscussionsChannel(channelId))` for
 *   mentions/messages; `NotificationPressAction.Route(NavRoute.PrivateChat(channelId))`
 *   for DMs, once #590 ships. Both routes are already flagged as needed in
 *   project_milestone11_community_poc.md agent memory — not yet in NavRoute.kt.
 *
 * RELAYED path: mirrors the EXISTING `tradeId`-in-payload / graceful-fallback pattern
 * exactly (`BisqFirebaseMessagingService.deepLinkRouteFor` / the iOS NSE's
 * `deepLinkUri(tradeId:)`).
 * [2026-08-16] Neither of those two symbols exists any more — the routing they named is now a
 * property of `PushNotification`, decided once in its `from(...)`. The pattern this paragraph
 * describes is what shipped; only the names moved.
 * The trusted node needs to add an equivalent optional
 * `channelId` (Discussions) / `conversationId` (DM) field to the decrypted payload,
 * mirroring how `tradeId` was added for bisq-network/bisq-mobile#1395:
 *   - Field present → tap deep-links straight to that channel/DM
 *     (`bisq://DiscussionsChannel/<id>` / `bisq://PrivateChat/<id>`).
 *   - Field absent (older trusted node) → tap falls back to `NavRoute.CommunityHub`
 *     (the hub root), exactly as an absent `tradeId` today falls back to the open-trades
 *     list rather than failing to navigate at all.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * BACKGROUNDED vs. KILLED — which path fires, concretely
 * ======================================================================================
 * This app's existing model (see `OpenTradesNotificationService.setKeepProcessAlive` /
 * `setLocalDeliverySuppressed`) is not literally "backgrounded=local, killed=relay" —
 * it's:
 *   - Backgrounded, process kept alive (default; user has NOT opted into relayed mode,
 *     and OS notification permission is granted) → LOCAL rich path fires, full copy
 *     above, deep-links directly.
 *   - Backgrounded with relayed mode opted in, OR the OS has killed the process (either
 *     because the user opted out of "keep connected" or the OS reclaimed it), OR the app
 *     is fully force-killed → RELAYED generic path fires, existing "New message" text,
 *     deep-links via the trusted-node-supplied id when present.
 * Community notifications slot into this SAME decision point with no new branching
 * logic — `observeChatMessages`-style observers just need to also watch Discussions
 * channel messages (filtered by notification mode) and, once #590 ships, DM messages,
 * calling the same `notify { ... }` builder with the copy above.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * DEPENDENCY ON #590
 * ======================================================================================
 * Discussions mention/message notifications (LOCAL + RELAYED, both copy variants) can
 * ship THIS milestone alongside #589 — they only need an observer on Discussions channel
 * messages, which is new work but not blocked on anything. DM notifications are
 * necessarily blocked on #590 (there is no DM feature to notify about yet) — but no
 * notification-INFRASTRUCTURE work is blocked: same category, same channel, same
 * `notify{}` builder, same relayed-payload-field pattern. When #590 ships, wiring its
 * notifications is "add an observer + these two i18n keys", not new plumbing.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * WHY THESE ARE MOCK PREVIEWS
 * ======================================================================================
 * `NotificationCompat`/`UNMutableNotificationContent` are OS APIs — Android's status bar
 * and iOS's lock screen render them outside the Compose tree entirely, so there is no
 * real system-notification `@Preview` possible in this codebase (or any Compose app).
 * `MockSystemNotificationCard` below is an ILLUSTRATIVE STAND-IN ONLY, styled loosely
 * like a notification (app icon, title, body, timestamp) so the COPY can be reviewed
 * visually — it does not attempt to replicate real Android/iOS notification chrome
 * pixel-for-pixel, and every preview using it is labelled "MOCK" for that reason.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * i18n KEYS NEEDED (new)
 * ======================================================================================
 * mobile.communityNotifications.newDirectMessage.title   → "New private message"
 * mobile.communityNotifications.newDirectMessage.message → "{0}: {1}"
 * mobile.communityNotifications.channelMention.title     → "You were mentioned in {0}"
 * mobile.communityNotifications.channelMention.message   → "{0}: {1}"
 * mobile.communityNotifications.channelMessage.title     → "New message in {0}"
 * mobile.communityNotifications.channelMessage.message   → "{0}: {1}"
 * (Relayed/generic copy reuses the EXISTING mobile.pushNotifications.category.chatMessage
 * — do not duplicate.)
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * TEXT EXPANSION
 * ======================================================================================
 * "You were mentioned in {0}" in German: "Du wurdest in {0} erwähnt" (~15% longer,
 * restructures around the placeholder — translators need the placeholder position
 * unconstrained, not assumed to stay at the end). System notification title lines are
 * typically OS-truncated regardless (Android ~1 line, iOS ~2 lines) — this is normal and
 * matches how the existing "Trade [{0}]" title already behaves for long trade ids.
