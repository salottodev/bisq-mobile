/**
 * CommunityEntryPointDesign.kt — Design PoC (Milestone 11 "Bisq community")
 *
 * STATUS: Design proof-of-concept. NOT wired to any presenter or production code.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * IA DECISION THIS IMPLEMENTS
 * ======================================================================================
 * Per the milestone-11 IA recommendation (see agent memory:
 * project_milestone11_community_ia.md), the community cluster — public channels (#589),
 * private DMs (#590, fast-follow), Contacts (#1238, fast-follow) — is entered through a
 * single ambient top-bar icon, NOT a 5th bottom-nav tab. Reasoning recap:
 *   - The bottom nav (Home · Offers · My Trades · More, see TabContainerScreen.kt L54-76)
 *     is already at capacity; a 5th tab would crowd the app's core economic loop.
 *   - The TopBar has exactly one free slot (its `extraActions` RowScope slot, rendered
 *     BEFORE the user avatar — see TopBar.kt L69/L121/L160-162), which is used here.
 *   - The icon is persistent across all 4 tabs (TopBar is shared chrome, rendered once
 *     in TabContainerScreen.kt), so it is reachable from anywhere without a tab switch —
 *     this is the "return to an open conversation" ambient path that private DMs need.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * COMPONENT UNDER DESIGN: CommunityTopBarIcon
 * ======================================================================================
 * Renders inside TopBar's `extraActions` slot:
 * ```
 * TopBar(
 *     title = ...,
 *     extraActions = { CommunityTopBarIcon(unreadCount, showAnimation, onClick) },
 * )
 * ```
 * This is a global affordance — it should be added to the ONE shared TopBar call site
 * in TabContainerScreen.kt (~L85-98), not per-screen, so it appears on Home/Offers/
 * My Trades/More identically.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * ICON CHOICE
 * ======================================================================================
 * Uses `ChatIconOutlined` — an existing production icon atom
 * (common/ui/components/atoms/icons/Icons.kt, backed by drawable/icon_chat_outlined.png).
 * Outline (not filled) mirrors the rationale already established by
 * `OpenPrivateChatIconButton` in design/community/private_chat/OpenPrivateChatButtonDesign.kt: an outline
 * icon reads as an ambient, low-weight affordance rather than a heavy, attention-grabbing
 * one, which matters here because this icon is visible on every screen at all times.
 * It must not visually compete with the user's own profile avatar directly beside it.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * BADGE
 * ======================================================================================
 * Reuses the existing `AnimatedBadge` atom (atoms/animations/AnimatedBadge.kt) — the same
 * pulse mechanic already used by the bottom-nav My-Trades unread badge
 * (BottomNavigation.kt, MY_TRADES_TAB_INDEX). Per the IA note, that badge is currently
 * hard-coded to one tab index; generalizing its "count → pill" logic into a shared helper
 * benefits both call sites and is flagged there as follow-up work, not solved here.
 *
 * Count formatting caps at "99+" (`formatUnreadBadgeCount`), consistent with the
 * mainstream-messaging-app convention (WhatsApp/Telegram) of never letting a 3+ digit
 * unread count blow out the badge's fixed pill shape.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BADGE SEMANTICS — what the number means, precisely (review pass, rodvar's #1)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DEFINITION: `unreadCount` is the GLOBAL community unread count — the sum of
 *   (a) the Discussion channel's own unread count (`CommunityHubUiState.discussionsUnreadCount`,
 *       per bisq2's own per-channel notification rule, `ChatChannelNotificationTypeEnum` —
 *       GLOBAL_DEFAULT/ALL/MENTION/OFF; see CommunityPushNotificationsDesign.kt for why
 *       MENTION is the recommended default for a busy public channel) — SHIPS THIS
 *       MILESTONE, and
 *   (b) private-DM unread (#590, folds in once Messages ships) — NOT counted this
 *       milestone because there is nothing to count yet.
 * THIS MILESTONE, `CommunityHubUiState.liveSegments = {DISCUSSIONS}` (see
 * CommunityHubScreenDesign.kt's "GATED ROLLOUT"), so `unreadCount` == the Discussion
 * channel's unread only — there's nothing else live to sum yet. The badge's math does not
 * change shape when DMs ship — it simply gains a second addend as `liveSegments` grows.
 * No caller code needs to change, only what it sums.
 *
 * The Support channel is DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED from this sum, permanently — not just this
 * milestone. Support isn't a segment (see CommunityHubScreenDesign.kt's "SUPPORT —
 * HUB-SIDE REFERENCE"), so it has no `liveSegments` entry to grow into and never will
 * under this design. This keeps the aggregate a strict 2-source sum (Discussions +
 * Messages) rather than reopening the "what kind of unread is this" ambiguity discussed
 * below with a third, un-badged source.
 *
 * "HOW DOES THE USER KNOW THEY HAVE A NEW DM SPECIFICALLY?" — the drill-down path (once
 * Messages is live and its segment tab is visible):
 *   1. GLOBAL badge (this component) increments — tells the user "something in
 *      Community needs attention" from anywhere in the app.
 *   2. Inside the hub, the **Messages segment** of `CommunitySegmentedTabRow`
 *      (CommunityHubScreenDesign.kt) shows its OWN count next to its label — tells the
 *      user "the new thing is a message, not a channel reply", narrowing from "global"
 *      to "which segment".
 *   3. The specific **conversation row** (`ConversationRow` in
 *      PrivateChatListScreenDesign.kt — see `ConversationRow_WithUnreadPreview`) shows
 *      its own unread pill — tells the user exactly WHO it's from.
 * A DM is never invisible: it is always represented at all three levels simultaneously.
 * `CommunityHubScreen_TwoSegmentsLivePreview` and
 * `CommunityHubScreen_AllSegmentsLiveInteractivePreview` (CommunityHubScreenDesign.kt —
 * both states of the SAME canonical hub design, not a separate "future" screen) already
 * pass real per-segment `counts` to `CommunitySegmentedTabRow` for level 2; the
 * `CommunityTopBarIcon_DrillDownPreview` below proves level 1's number is exactly the
 * sum of level 2's numbers, and points to level 3.
 *
 * IS A SINGLE AGGREGATE BADGE AMBIGUOUS (channel mention vs. DM)? Yes, at level 1 alone
 * — a lone "5" on the top-bar icon does not say whether that's 5 channel mentions, 5 DM
 * messages, or a mix. RECOMMENDATION: accept that ambiguity at the global level and rely
 * on the drill-down above to resolve it one tap in, rather than over-building. Rationale:
 * (a) this milestone the ambiguity doesn't exist yet — Discussions is the only source;
 * (b) once DMs ship, the two sources are both "someone wants your attention in
 * Community" — the SAME mainstream apps this design already takes cues from (WhatsApp's
 * app-icon badge, Telegram's) also use one aggregate number at the outermost level and
 * resolve the "what kind" question one screen in, not at the icon itself. If real usage
 * shows this reads as confusing once DMs exist, the two options to consider THEN
 * (not now) are: a colour-coded split badge (e.g. green pill for channels, a distinct
 * accent for DMs) or two small dots instead of one pill. Neither is built here —
 * documented as the fallback path only.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BUG FIX (found by rodvar in review): badge was clipped, count not visible
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `AnimatedBadge`'s defaults (`xOffset = 8.dp, yOffset = (-8).dp`) were tuned for the
 * bottom-nav context, where `BottomNavigation.kt` places the badge inside a `Column`
 * that has generous surrounding room (icon + gap + label text below → ~72 dp of total
 * allocated item height). Material3's `TopAppBar` is a fixed ~64 dp `Surface`, which
 * clips its content to its own rectangular bounds. `BadgedBox` already anchors the badge
 * at the icon's top-end corner by default; stacking `AnimatedBadge`'s additional
 * `(+8 dp, -8 dp)` offset on top of that pushed the pill's top edge above the TopAppBar's
 * clip boundary, so the count was cut off — the icon and its positioning inside the
 * `extraActions` slot were correct and unaffected.
 *
 * Fix: override `AnimatedBadge`'s offsets with much smaller values tuned for this
 * compact context (`xOffset = 2.dp, yOffset = (-2).dp`), and give the `BadgedBox` a
 * couple of dp of its own padding as extra breathing room. This keeps the badge fully
 * inside the TopAppBar's bounds at every unread-count width (including "99+") while
 * still reading as a top-right corner badge. `PrivateChatListScreenDesign.kt`'s
 * `ConversationRow` and `CommunityHubScreenDesign.kt`'s `ChannelRow` sidestep this
 * failure mode entirely by using a plain `Box` pill instead of `BadgedBox` — they have
 * no ancestor with a fixed-height clipping `Surface`, but this component does, hence
 * the different treatment here.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * NAVIGATION (not implemented here — documented for the implementation pass)
 * ======================================================================================
 * Tapping always PUSHES a full screen (`NavRoute.CommunityHub`, new route to add to
 * NavRoute.kt) — never a bottom sheet or popup. This mirrors Instagram/Twitter's DM-icon
 * behaviour: a persistent global icon that always opens a real, navigable screen, so the
 * destination has room to grow (segmented tabs, search, etc.) without redesigning the
 * entry point later.
 *
 * WHAT THE USER ACTUALLY SEES ON TAP, today vs. later — see
 * `CommunityHubScreenDesign.kt`'s "WHAT OPENS WHEN THE USER TAPS THE ICON" for the
 * canonical answer (don't duplicate the full explanation here, just the pointer): the
 * destination is always the SAME `CommunityHubScreenContent`; at milestone 11 it renders
 * with no tab row at all — straight into the Discussion channel's thread with a pinned
 * Support reference — and only grows the segmented tab row as #590/#1238 ship. The
 * "segmented tabs" mentioned in the paragraph above is room the destination has to grow
 * INTO, not what it looks like on day one.
 *
 * ======================================================================================
 * i18n KEYS NEEDED
 * ======================================================================================
 * mobile.community.entry.contentDescription → "Community" (accessibility label baseline;
 *   production should also announce the unread count, e.g. via a dynamic a11y label —
 *   not modeled here since this PoC intentionally avoids `semantics { contentDescription }`
 *   in favour of `Modifier.testTag(...)` per this project's PoC convention. Wiring the
 *   real accessibility label is an implementation-time task, not a design decision.)
 *
 * No other strings in this file are user-visible (the badge shows only digits).
